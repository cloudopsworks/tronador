*Example of using the `tronador` to build a docker image*



## Usage



At the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...

```make
-include $(shell curl -sSL -o .tronador "https://cowk.io/acc"; echo .tronador)
```

This will download a `Makefile` called `.tronador` and include it at run-time. We recommend adding the `.tronador` file to your `.gitignore`.

This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.

Run `make help` for a list of available targets.

**NOTE:** the `/` is interchangable with the `:` in target names

## GitHub Actions

The `tronador` is compatible with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

Here's an example of running `make readme/lint` 

```
name: tronador/readme/lint
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    name: 'Lint README.md'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - uses: cloudopsworks/tronador@master
      with:
        entrypoint: /usr/bin/make
        args: readme/lint
 ```

## Quick Start

Here's how to get started...

1. `git clone https://github.com/cloudopsworks/tronador.git` to pull down the repository
2. `make init` to initialize the [`tronador`](https://github.com/cloudopsworks/tronador/)
